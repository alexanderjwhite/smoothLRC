Description: Smooth low-rank clustering (smoothLRC) provides tools for clustering spatial transcriptomics data.
  smoothLRC presents a regularized maximum likelihood estimator to approximate the noisy ob-
  served expression matrix to both incorporate spatial information and address expression
  dropout. This approximation under the Poisson distribution is both low-rank and spatially
  smooth. Furthermore, smoothLRC enables spatial clustering by modeling a low-dimensional
  representation of the count-based gene expression matrix. Thus, our approach encourages
  neighboring cells to belong to the same cluster via penalized matrix decomposition.
